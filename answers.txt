Part 1: Write your message here from GitHub
Ok, I'm writing something.

Task 1: 
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does
It get updates from the master branch. But unlike pull, this only updates the status and then you can check if the version at the computer is different than the one on the master branch.

Task 2:
// Under this line, describe the difference between Git and GitHub
Git is a version control system and Github is a service plateform for Git so we don't have to stare at all those lines.
